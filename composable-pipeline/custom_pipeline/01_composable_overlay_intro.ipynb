    "A Composable Overlay is an overlay with a novel and clever architecture that allow us to adapt how the data flows between the IP cores connected to the switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key characteristic of a composable overlay is an AXI4-Stream Switch at its core, which plays the same role as an old [telephone switchboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_switchboard). The AXI4-Stream Switch provides the runtime routing of the data flow from one IP to another in a one to one manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, the composable overlay includes DFX (partial reconfigurable) regions that can bring new functionality to the design.\n",

    "The `ComposableOverlay` class inherits from the pynq [`Overlay` class](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pynq_libraries/overlay.html#overlay) and enhances it by including the `.composable` hierarchy using the `Composable` class which abstracts the Composable Overlay logic in a pythonic way.\n",
